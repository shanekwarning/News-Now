# News Now
  ### About The Project

News Now allows the user to browse news articles, see a breif overview of the article and be able to click the link to the articles source at the NYT webpage. 

This was a part of Turing School Software & Design take home challenge.

### Getting Started
 1. Clone this repo to your location machine from [Here](git@github.com:shanekwarning/News-Now.git)
 2. cd into news-now
 3. Next you will want to run in your command line: `npm install`. You will not want to run npm audit fix.
 4. To open the application in your browser you will want to run `npm start`. This will run webpack from your terminal. It should show in your terminal http://localhost:3000/
 5. Copy and past http://localhost:3000/ to your webbrowser. Google Chrome may work best. 
 6. Once you are done viewing the application you can go back to your terminal to close it. You will want to type Control + C and this will stop webpack from running on your local host. 

### Using the Application



  * View a Article's Overview - To view an arcticles overview, a user can click on a specific article of their choice on the homepage. They will be taken to another page to view the overview.
   
  * Link to the NYT - To go to the full article users can click the article title from the article overview page to be taken to the NYT page.
